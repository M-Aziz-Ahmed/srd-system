## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (optional, uses mock data by default)
- Pusher account (optional, uses mock events by default)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd srds-gemini-scaffold
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Configure environment variables in `.env.local`:

```env
# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# MongoDB (optional)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/srd-system

# Pusher (optional - for real-time features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your-pusher-key
PUSHER_APP_ID=your-app-id
PUSHER_SECRET=your-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your-cluster
```

5. Seed the dynamic system (departments, stages, fields):
```bash
npm run seed:dynamic
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## 🎨 Dynamic System

The system now features a fully customizable architecture! See [QUICK_START_DYNAMIC.md](QUICK_START_DYNAMIC.md) for a quick guide or [DYNAMIC_SYSTEM.md](DYNAMIC_SYSTEM.md) for complete documentation.

### Configuration Pages
- **Settings Hub**: `/settings` - Central configuration dashboard
- **Departments**: `/departments` - Manage organizational departments
- **Stages**: `/stages` - Configure workflow stages with colors and icons
- **SRD Fields**: `/srdfields` - Add custom fields to SRD records

All configuration is done through the UI - no code changes required!

## Demo Accounts

Use these credentials to test different roles:

| Email | Password | Role | Access |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| vmd@demo.com | password | VMD Manager | Create SRDs, view all SRDs |
| cad@demo.com | password | CAD Manager | CAD processes, subprocess tracking |
| commercial@demo.com | password | Commercial Manager | Supplier quotes, procurement |
| mmc@demo.com | password | MMC Manager | Production, quality control |
| admin@demo.com | password | Admin | Full system access |

## Usage Guide

### Creating an SRD (VMD)
1. Login as VMD Manager
2. Click "Create SRD" 
3. Fill in the sample details and requirements
4. Submit to automatically assign to all departments

### Department Workflows

#### VMD (Visual Merchandising & Design)
- Creates initial SRD with priority and specifications
- Reviews and approves final samples
- Can view all SRDs and department statuses

#### CAD (Computer Aided Design)
- Receives SRD after VMD approval
- Updates technical specifications (consumption, shrinkage, etc.)
- Tracks subprocesses: Sewing, Stitching, Cutting, Finishing
- Can flag issues with required comments

#### Commercial
- Handles supplier quotations and procurement
- Updates cost, lead time, and availability
- Manages supplier relationships

#### MMC (Manufacturing & Quality Control)
- Plans production requirements
- Manages quality control processes
- Tracks machine requirements and production time

### Flagging Issues
Any department can flag an SRD that requires attention:
1. Change status to "Flagged"
2. Provide a detailed comment explaining the issue
3. VMD and Admin receive real-time notifications
4. Issue resolution is tracked in the timeline

### Real-Time Features
- Live notifications for new SRDs, updates, and flags
- Progress bars update automatically
- Comments and status changes appear instantly
- Toast notifications for important events

## API Endpoints

### SRD Management
- `GET /api/srd` - List SRDs with filters
- `POST /api/srd/create` - Create new SRD
- `GET /api/srd/[id]` - Get SRD details
- `PATCH /api/srd/[id]/department/[dept]` - Update department status
- `GET /api/srd/[id]/timeline` - Get activity timeline

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/session` - Get current session

### System
- `GET /api/departments` - List departments
- `GET /api/users` - List users

## Customization

### Adding New Departments
1. Update the `getDepartments()` function in `lib/mockData.js`
2. Add department-specific fields to the SRD model
3. Create department-specific UI components
4. Update role-based routing and access control

### Modifying CAD Subprocesses
1. Update the `cadSubprocesses` schema in `models/SRD.js`
2. Modify the `CadSubprocessPanel` component
3. Update the `getOverallProgress` calculation

### Styling
- The app uses Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Customize colors and themes in `app/globals.css`
- Component variants can be modified in individual component files

## Production Deployment

1. Set up production environment variables
2. Configure real MongoDB connection
3. Set up Pusher for real-time features
4. Build and deploy:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication not working**
   - Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET in environment variables
   - Ensure NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain

2. **Real-time features not working**
   - Verify Pusher credentials
   - Check browser console for WebSocket errors

3. **Database connection issues**
   - For development, mock data is used by default
   - For production, ensure MONGODB_URI is correct

4. **Build errors**
   - Clear `.next` directory: `rm -rf .next`
   - Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
